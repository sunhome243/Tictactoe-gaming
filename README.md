## Project Description

Welcome to my second projectâ€”a fully functional web application for the popular board game, Tic-Tac-Toe. This interactive platform brings the timeless game to life with a user-friendly interface and robust functionality.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: JavaScript, CSS, and HTML
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Jenkins

### **Features**

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Enjoy a seamless gaming experience with a front end built using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, ensuring accessibility and ease of use for players of all skill levels.
- **Single Player and Two Player Modes Supported**: Choose between single player mode, where you play against an AI opponent powered by the Python minimax algorithm, or two player mode for head-to-head matches with friends. Challenge each other and enjoy the thrill of strategic battles with your pals.
- **Balanced AI**: In single player mode, the AI is programmed to provide a challenging yet fair experience. By incorporating random movement alongside the minimax algorithm, the AI offers dynamic gameplay with a mix of strategic and unpredictable moves.
- **Fair Start Player Randomization**: To ensure fairness, the application randomizes the starting player in two player mode, giving each player an equal opportunity to make the first move and set the tone for the game.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of your performance with built-in score tracking, which records win scores, win streaks, and best streaks. Challenge yourself to beat your own records and become the ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe champion!
- **Containerization and Orchestration**: Utilizing Docker and Kubernetes, the application is containerized and orchestrated for efficient deployment and scalability.
